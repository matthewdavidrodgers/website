Not too much to update here - going to New York in a week, will hang with some friends, see some of my team. It'll be a good time.

Season 2 of Hacks ended this week, and it was a knockout through and through. The creators seemed to have deliberately written the ending to function as either a season or a series finale, and given that there's been no announcement so far of a pick up for season 3, I'm terrified that it will be the latter. I mean, the show won 3 emmys for season 1: lead actress, writing, and directing. What is HBO thinking if they don't pick it up again?

Also played the DLC for Outer Wilds last week: Echoes of the Eye. It's really fantastic - a great continuation of what they set up in the main game, even leaning into more spooky/suspenseful elements. I _almost_ made it through the game without a hint, but I ended up caving twice. One of those times it was definitely needed, there was no way I was going to figure it out. 

After that I've picked up a little bit of Zero Ranger, which is just so well crafted. Don't know if I'll get very far in it, but it's super fun.

I've been reading through [Kubernetes in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action) slowly this week. I find Kubernetes generally pretty boring, so much orchestration. But it's a useful skill to have - and the book is really helpful.
