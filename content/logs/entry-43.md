Quick entry here, as I'm about to run to a baseball game. Saw Doss this weekend, a DJ I'm a big fan of. She was incredible, and it was really fun to do some serious dancing again.

Some good thoughts from [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lost-thread/) about all the Twitter news this week, and he hints that he's working on a project about some sort of alternative! Really interested as to what that could be. I enjoy the way Robin thinks about how technology and its potential, so even if the project is a mess I'm sure it will be interesting!

Another post from Amos about [Go](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/lies-we-tell-ourselves-to-keep-using-golang) this week, following up from yet another instance of an [older post](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride) making the rounds on the Hacker News front page again. I actually liked this newest post. It felt much more measured than previous posts of his, but it has somehow sparked more vitriol. He was apparently getting DoS'd for a second there, which seems a bit extreme.

Think I'll leave it there for now. Off to the Dodgers!
