Alright, finally have some time to do a short update.

Getting my first taste for being on call at work this week - meaning I need to be available 24/7 if something goes wrong. I've already gotten paged twice, although neither of them past 8pm, which is nice (but probably a luxury that won't be the norm).

One of the benefits of being on call is really honing your debugging skills. I feel like a real Go programmer now; we had a couple of alerts fire after a deployment went live this week, and I was actually able to dig in to the code and root out a pesky bug that slipped review.

Speaking of Go, I really enjoyed this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qAfkJGWsns) from GopherCon 2022, about Go's tooling around profiling. Really informative, but also just a really engaging talk, with really fun speaker.

Some other fun things from the past couple of weeks: I found a great artist: Logan Stahl. His [website](https://tachyonart.neocities.org/) is chock full of fun characters and illustrations, and I've since followed his newsletter - it's included some great interviews with other artists.

One of these interviews even tipped me off to a new author: Gene Wolfe. As I read more and more sci-fi, the more I want the weirder and expansive stuff. I know nothing about Gene Wolfe and have never read his work, but based on the interview, this [piece in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/sci-fis-difficult-genius), and Ursula K Le Guin's quote calling him "our Melville", he has shot to the top of my to-read list.

As for other reading, I finished The City & The City, which was great. It was much more straightforward than I anticipated, which I suppose I was let down by. It's mostly a familiar police/detective story, just set in an inventive fantastical setting. Nothing wrong with it, but I expected a more bizarre ending. I'm a fan of the author now though, and I just picked up another book of his: October: The Story of the Russian Revolution. From what I can tell, it's a history of the Russian Revolution, but told almost narratively. Looking forward to it. 

I'm almost done with a book I picked up a while ago: Dawn Song. It's interesting; a horror novel that almost veers to the erotic. It's about a succubus that settles into Boston in the early nineties, an emissary of a demon lord vying for power in hell. It follows her and a collection of citizens as they navigate their own lives, full of their own hope and despair. It's not very pulp-y, however. It's dense and dark. I'm enjoying it so far, but we'll see how it goes.

To close out, here's [John Howe's website](https://www.john-howe.com/portfolio/gallery/). This is another find from Logan Stahl's site. John Howe is absolutely the best Tolkien illustrator, and seeing these gorgeous drawings is such a treat. I'm not watching the new Amazon Lord of the Rings show, so this is what I'm satiating my FOMO with.
