Just a quick one here; I'm pretty tired, but it's been three weeks since my last log. Oops.

The cat is out of the bag: [I'm joining Cloudflare](/posts/cloudflare)! This has been in the works for a while, and I'm incredibly excited. Friday was my last day at CAA, and I have 2 weeks until I start on the Workers team. Much to talk about, but I'll save it for a later update.

Time to let another cat out of the bag, literally this time! I adopted a kitten! Her name is Ripley, and she's absolutely perfect. I'll post some photos soon enough. 

I also went to Mammoth to do some skiing, and it went... better than expected! I started horribly, but ended like I almost knew what I was doing!

Keeping it brief today, but I obviously have much to talk about. I'll save it for next week!
