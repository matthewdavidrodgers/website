Just got out of Barbarian, a new horror movie. Went in totally blind, and wow-- that was definitely the way to do it. Insanely good pacing and tension. Had to watch between my fingers at points. Some guy's ringtone went of during the finale and I will never forgive him.

I finally bit the bullet and started using [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), particularly with vim. I try to avoid "tricking out" my vim installation, mainly because it's really nice to drop into a fresh instance of vim on a new computer or over ssh and instantly be productive. 

But recently I'd noticed I'd been hopping to vscode frequently. Not a bad development; it's a great piece of software. But I love the ability to include my editor with my terminal (via tmux) session, and vscode definitely is a separate piece of software (and I don't love integrated terminals). But anyway-- it's cumbersome to "find" files in vim, which is not the case in vscode. So I figured I'd give vim (any the entire terminal experience) a nice leg up.

Now the only thing that will have me hopping back to vscode now is probably great autocomplete and lsp integration. I'm trying to avoid biting that bullet, as that probably means moving to neovim, which is a whole other can of worms. I'm hoping my grep-fu is good enough on that front for the time being.

Been playing Subnautica, and I'm really surprised by how much fun I'm having. Survival games aren't usually my jam, but I think the very strong focus on a narrative story and cultivated enviroment have won me over-- usually games in this vein opt for you to find your own fun in a prodedurally generated world.

Some other things I've read this week: [True Crime Is Rotting Our Brains](https://www.gawker.com/culture/true-crime-is-rotting-our-brains), which echoes a sentiment that has slowly been growing stronger for me from a different (and crucial perspective); An [opinion article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/20/opinion/roe-heard-feminism-backlash.html) on celebrity and feminism that is hard to avoid nowadays; and [Our Godard](https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/our-godard/), a beautiful look back at Jean-Luc Godard, which really nails how challenging his work was, both as a barrier to entry but also as a crucial voice, flailing against walls and what art can do. RIP!!!
